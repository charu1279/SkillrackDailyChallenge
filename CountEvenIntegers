The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print the number of even integers that can be formed from the digits of N without changing the order of their occurrences.
Note: There are no leading zeroes in the even integers.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^8

Input Format:
The first line contains N.

Output Format:
The first line contains the number of even integers that can be formed from the digits of N.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5234

Output:
6

Explanation:
All possible even integers that can be formed from the digits of 5234 are given below.
52
5234
2
234
34
4
The number of possible even integers is 6. So 6 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
20406

Output:
9

Explanation:
All possible even integers that can be formed from the digits of 20406 are given below.
2
20
204
2040
20406
4
40
406
6
The number of possible even integers is 9. So 9 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
2424

Output:
10
